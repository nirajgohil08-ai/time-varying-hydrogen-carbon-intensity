# Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Tax Credit Alignment

This repository supports emissions accounting requirements under
Section 45V of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.

The Inflation Reduction Act provides tax credits for hydrogen production
based on lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions intensity measured in
kg CO₂e per kg H₂.

Accurate qualification requires:

- time-matched electricity sourcing
- hourly grid emissions modeling
- avoidance of annual-average emissions factors
- transparent lifecycle system boundaries

This framework enables:

- hourly-resolved hydrogen CI estimation
- spatio-temporal emissions attribution
- threshold evaluation against 45V tiers
- prevention of emissions arbitrage

The modeling approach aligns with guidance from:

- U.S. Department of the Treasury
- Department of Energy Hydrogen Shot
- National Renewable Energy Laboratory
- Argonne National Laboratory GREET methodology

This work supports environmentally credible hydrogen deployment and
responsible allocation of federal incentives.
