# Time-Varying Hydrogen Carbon Intensity Modeling Framework

A research-grade systems modeling framework for quantifying **hourly life-cycle carbon intensity of electrolytic hydrogen** under time-varying electricity grid conditions.

This work supports policy-aligned emissions accounting for clean hydrogen deployment, including qualification analysis under **U.S. Inflation Reduction Act Section 45V**.

---

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository documents original research and modeling tools developed to address a nationally important challenge:

**accurate measurement of hydrogen carbon intensity under real-world grid operations.**

Traditional annual-average emissions methods fail to represent true operational emissions behavior, creating risk for federal incentive misallocation and reduced environmental integrity.

This work provides a transparent, reproducible framework for **spatio-temporal hydrogen life-cycle assessment**.

## National Interest Waiver Alignment – Dhanasar Prong 1

This repository directly supports a nationally important endeavor within the United States focused on improving the accuracy, credibility, and policy alignment of hydrogen lifecycle emissions accounting.

### National Importance Context

Clean hydrogen is a strategic pillar of U.S. energy and climate policy, supported through:

- The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)
- Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit
- U.S. Department of Energy Hydrogen Shot initiative
- Federally funded Hydrogen Hub (H2Hub) programs

More than $7 billion in federal funding has been allocated to accelerate clean hydrogen deployment nationwide.  
Accurate lifecycle carbon intensity modeling is essential to ensure that these investments achieve intended climate outcomes.

### Problem of National Significance

Current industry practice commonly relies on:

- annual-average grid emissions factors  
- static electricity assumptions  
- coarse temporal system boundaries  

These approaches fail to capture real-world grid operations and can:

- materially misrepresent hydrogen lifecycle emissions  
- allow qualification of high-emissions hydrogen for federal incentives  
- create emissions arbitrage across regions and time periods  
- undermine public trust in federal decarbonization programs  

Federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Energy, U.S. Treasury, NREL, and Argonne National Laboratory have identified time-resolved emissions accounting as a critical unresolved challenge.

### Contribution of This Work

This repository advances nationally important objectives by enabling:

- **hourly-resolved hydrogen carbon intensity estimation**
- **spatio-temporal emissions attribution**
- **explicit modeling of grid dispatch variability**
- **policy-aligned evaluation under Section 45V thresholds**
- **avoidance of annual-average emissions bias**

The framework integrates:

- Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)
- Hetero-functional Graph Theory (HFGT)
- Process-based Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
- Time-varying electricity emissions data

This enables decision-relevant emissions analysis aligned with emerging federal guidance.

### National Benefit

The methods implemented in this repository support:

- credible qualification of hydrogen projects under federal tax incentives  
- responsible allocation of public funding  
- prevention of lifecycle emissions misreporting  
- improved regulatory enforcement and transparency  
- accelerated deployment of genuinely low-carbon hydrogen systems  

Accordingly, the work documented in this repository addresses a problem of substantial national importance to U.S. energy security, climate policy integrity, and federal infrastructure investment effectiveness.
