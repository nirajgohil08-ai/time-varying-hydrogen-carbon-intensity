# Time-Varying Hydrogen Carbon Intensity Modeling Framework

A research-grade systems modeling framework for quantifying **hourly life-cycle carbon intensity of electrolytic hydrogen** under time-varying electricity grid conditions.

This work supports policy-aligned emissions accounting for clean hydrogen deployment, including qualification analysis under the **U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit**.

---

## National Relevance Summary

Accurate lifecycle emissions accounting is a critical unresolved challenge in U.S. clean hydrogen deployment.

Current industry practice frequently relies on annual-average electricity emissions factors, which fail to represent real-world grid operations and can materially misclassify hydrogen carbon intensity.

This repository documents independent research addressing this nationally important problem by enabling:

- time-resolved hydrogen lifecycle emissions accounting  
- avoidance of annual-average emissions bias  
- transparent evaluation of policy compliance under Section 45V  
- protection of federal clean energy investments  

The methodologies documented here support analysis relevant to programs administered by:

- U.S. Department of Energy  
- U.S. Department of the Treasury  
- National Renewable Energy Laboratory  
- Argonne National Laboratory

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository documents original research and modeling tools developed to address a nationally important challenge:

**accurate measurement of hydrogen carbon intensity under real-world grid operations.**

Traditional static emissions accounting approaches fail to capture temporal variability in electricity systems, creating risk of emissions arbitrage, misallocation of federal incentives, and reduced environmental integrity.

This work provides a transparent and reproducible framework for **spatio-temporal hydrogen life-cycle assessment** using systems-based modeling methods.
