# Time-Varying Hydrogen Carbon Intensity Model

This repository contains a research-grade decision-support framework
for estimating the carbon intensity of electrolytic hydrogen production
using time-resolved electricity grid emissions data.

The model supports spatio-temporal analysis of hydrogen emissions and
enables comparison between annual-average and hourly-resolved life cycle
assessment approaches.

This repository accompanies ongoing research in hydrogen systems
modeling and decarbonization analysis.
