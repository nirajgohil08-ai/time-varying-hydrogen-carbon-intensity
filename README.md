# Time-Varying Hydrogen Carbon Intensity Modeling Framework

A research-grade systems modeling framework for quantifying **hourly life-cycle carbon intensity of electrolytic hydrogen** under time-varying electricity grid conditions.

This work supports policy-aligned emissions accounting for clean hydrogen deployment, including qualification analysis under **U.S. Inflation Reduction Act Section 45V**.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository documents original research and modeling tools developed to address a nationally important challenge:

**accurate measurement of hydrogen carbon intensity under real-world grid operations.**

Traditional annual-average emissions methods fail to represent true operational emissions behavior, creating risk for federal incentive misallocation and reduced environmental integrity.

This work provides a transparent, reproducible framework for **spatio-temporal hydrogen life-cycle assessment**.
