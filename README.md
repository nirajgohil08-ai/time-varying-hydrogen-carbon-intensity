# Time-Varying Hydrogen Carbon Intensity Model

This repository contains a research-grade decision-support framework for
estimating the carbon intensity of electrolytic hydrogen production using
time-resolved electricity grid emissions data.

The work resolves key limitations of conventional annual-average hydrogen
life cycle assessments by enabling spatio-temporal modeling at operational
time scales.
