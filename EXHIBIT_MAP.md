## Prong 1 – The Proposed Endeavor Has Substantial Merit and National Importance

**Objective:**  
Demonstrate that the work addresses a nationally important problem affecting U.S. energy policy, climate goals, and federal investment integrity.

### Supporting Evidence

- **Figure 1 – Hydrogen Life-Cycle System Architecture**  
  Demonstrates national-scale system boundaries spanning electricity generation, grid operations, electrolyzer dispatch, and hydrogen production.

- **Figure 5 – Full-Year Hourly Carbon Intensity Variability (8760 hours)**  
  Shows the magnitude of hourly emissions variability concealed by annual-average accounting methods, directly relevant to Section 45V qualification.

- **Policy Alignment – IRA Section 45V (`policy/45V_alignment.md`)**  
  Establishes direct relevance to federal clean hydrogen tax credit implementation.

- **Research Publications (PDFs)**  
  Provide peer-reviewed scientific foundation supporting national energy modeling challenges.

## Prong 2 – The Petitioner Is Well Positioned to Advance the Endeavor

**Objective:**  
Demonstrate technical expertise, original contribution, and capacity for continued advancement.

### Supporting Evidence

- **Figure 2 – HFGT Formal Meta-Architecture**  
  Demonstrates original systems modeling framework developed by the petitioner.

- **Figure 3 – HFGT Incidence Matrix**  
  Provides mathematical formalization of the hydrogen life-cycle system.

- **Figure 4 – Validation Against Electricity Maps**  
  Confirms accuracy of the modeling framework using independent real-world datasets.

- **Publications in International Journals**  
  - Journal of Cleaner Production  
  - International Journal of Hydrogen Energy

- **Cross-Institutional Research Collaboration**  
  - Stevens Institute of Technology  
  - CSIRO (Australia)  
  - Argonne National Laboratory (U.S. DOE)

## Prong 3 – On Balance, the United States Benefits From Waiving Labor Certification

**Objective:**  
Demonstrate that the public benefit of this work outweighs the purpose of labor market testing.

### Supporting Evidence

- **Dhanasar Prong 3 Narrative (`dhanasar/prong3_balance_of_benefits.md`)**

- **Figure 5 – Hourly Carbon Intensity Results**  
  Demonstrates the necessity of independent, non-employer-restricted research applicable across states and grid regions.

- **Open, Reproducible Modeling Framework**  
  Supports federal agencies, regulators, and hydrogen developers beyond any single employer.

## Summary

The materials contained in this repository collectively demonstrate:

- a nationally important technical problem  
- original and validated methodological contributions  
- alignment with urgent federal clean energy programs  
- independent public-interest research value  

Accordingly, the evidence supports granting a National Interest Waiver under Matter of Dhanasar.
