# Dhanasar Prong 3 – Balance of Benefits

## Summary

Granting a National Interest Waiver in this case provides substantially greater benefit to the United States than requiring a permanent job offer and labor certification process.

The petitioner’s work addresses a nationally important technical gap in hydrogen lifecycle emissions accounting that cannot be effectively constrained to a single employer, location, or narrowly defined job description.

Requiring labor certification would materially hinder the advancement of this endeavor.

## Nature of the Work Requires Independence

The research documented in this repository involves:

- development of open, transparent modeling frameworks
- cross-institutional collaboration
- policy-aligned emissions accounting
- public-interest research supporting federal programs

This work is not employer-specific.

It spans:

- academic research
- national laboratory collaboration
- policy analysis
- open-source modeling
- multi-stakeholder energy systems evaluation

Restricting this endeavor to one employer would limit its national applicability.

---

## Labor Certification Is Ill-Suited for This Endeavor

The labor certification process is designed for:

- fixed job titles
- static job duties
- single-employer supervision
- narrowly defined occupational roles

In contrast, this endeavor requires:

- independent research judgment
- cross-sector engagement
- publication-driven advancement
- continuous methodological development
- responsiveness to evolving federal guidance

These characteristics are incompatible with traditional labor certification structures.

## National Interest Benefits of a Waiver

Granting a waiver enables:

- continued advancement of hydrogen emissions modeling aligned with federal policy
- independent validation of Section 45V qualification pathways
- support for federal hydrogen hub investments
- prevention of lifecycle emissions misreporting
- improved integrity of public incentive programs

The work directly supports:

- U.S. Department of Energy hydrogen initiatives
- Treasury implementation of clean hydrogen tax credits
- national decarbonization objectives
- energy security and grid reliability planning

---

## Public Benefit Outweighs Labor Market Protection

The petitioner’s work does not displace U.S. workers.

Instead, it:

- provides analytical tools used by industry, regulators, and policymakers
- improves decision quality for hydrogen project developers
- strengthens federal oversight capability
- reduces taxpayer exposure to misallocated incentives

The benefit accrues broadly to the United States economy and public institutions rather than to a single employer.

---

## Conclusion

Because the petitioner’s endeavor:

- addresses a nationally important technical problem
- requires independence beyond a single employer
- supports federal energy and climate programs
- provides public-interest analytical infrastructure

the United States derives substantially greater benefit from waiving the labor certification and job offer requirements than from enforcing them.

Accordingly, the balance of benefits strongly favors granting a National Interest Waiver.
