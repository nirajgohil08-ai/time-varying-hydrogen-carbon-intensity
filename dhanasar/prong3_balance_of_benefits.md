# Dhanasar Prong 3 – Balance of Benefits

## Summary

Waiving the labor certification requirement provides a clear benefit to the United States that outweighs the protections offered by the traditional PERM process.

The petitioner’s work focuses on accurate carbon intensity modeling of electrolytic hydrogen production under time-varying electricity grid conditions. This work directly supports federal climate policy implementation, clean hydrogen market integrity, and responsible allocation of public incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Requiring labor certification would delay or restrict deployment of urgently needed analytical capabilities that are national in scope and not tied to a single employer or job description.


## Limitations of the Labor Certification Process

The PERM labor certification framework is designed for:

- static job roles  
- employer-specific positions  
- narrowly defined occupational duties  

The petitioner’s work does not fit within these constraints.

This research:

- spans multiple institutions and agencies  
- supports national policy analysis rather than a single employer  
- evolves with regulatory guidance and grid conditions  
- requires independent publication and scientific validation  

Its value lies in public accessibility, methodological transparency, and cross-sector applicability, which cannot be achieved through employer-restricted sponsorship.


## National Interest Requires Independent Contribution

Accurate hydrogen lifecycle emissions accounting is required for:

- qualification under Section 45V tax credits  
- enforcement of time-matching and additionality rules  
- prevention of emissions arbitrage  
- protection of billions of dollars in federal investment  

These objectives require:

- independent modeling frameworks  
- transparent assumptions  
- peer-reviewed validation  
- dissemination beyond private employers  

Restricting this work to a single employer would reduce its usefulness to federal agencies and policymakers.


## Urgency of National Energy Transition

The United States is actively executing:

- the DOE Hydrogen Shot initiative  
- Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub deployment  
- Treasury implementation of Section 45V guidance  
- lifecycle emissions oversight across hydrogen markets  

These efforts are occurring in real time.

Delays created by labor certification would hinder:

- timely policy evaluation  
- rapid model refinement  
- dissemination of validated methodologies  

The national interest favors immediate and flexible contribution.


## Demonstrated Ability to Advance the Endeavor

The petitioner has demonstrated the ability to advance this endeavor through:

- peer-reviewed scientific publications  
- collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory  
- international research engagement with CSIRO  
- development of reproducible modeling frameworks using MBSE and HFGT methods  

This record establishes that the petitioner is already performing work of national value.


## Benefit to the United States

Granting a national interest waiver enables the petitioner to:

- continue independent research aligned with federal climate priorities  
- collaborate freely across public and private institutions  
- publish transparent methodologies usable by regulators and industry  
- reduce emissions accounting uncertainty  
- prevent misallocation of federal incentives  
- strengthen U.S. leadership in clean energy systems modeling  

These benefits extend nationally and cannot be achieved through employer-restricted labor certification.


## Conclusion

Given:

- the national importance of hydrogen emissions accounting  
- the petitioner’s demonstrated expertise  
- the urgency of federal hydrogen deployment  
- the need for independent, publicly accessible modeling frameworks  

the United States derives substantially greater benefit from waiving the labor certification requirement than from enforcing it.

Accordingly, the balance of benefits strongly favors granting a National Interest Waiver.
