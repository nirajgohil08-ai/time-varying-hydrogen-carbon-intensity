# Dhanasar Prong 3 – Balance of Benefits

## Summary

Granting a National Interest Waiver in this case provides substantially greater benefit to the United States than requiring a permanent job offer and labor certification process.

The petitioner’s work addresses a nationally important technical gap in hydrogen lifecycle emissions accounting that cannot be effectively constrained to a single employer, location, or narrowly defined job description.

Requiring labor certification would materially hinder the advancement of this endeavor.

---

## Nature of the Work Requires Independence

The research documented in this repository involves:

- development of open, transparent modeling frameworks
- cross-institutional collaboration
- policy-aligned emissions accounting
- public-interest research supporting federal programs

This work is not employer-specific.

It spans:

- academic research
- national laboratory collaboration
- policy analysis
- open-source modeling
- multi-stakeholder energy systems evaluation

Restricting this endeavor to one employer would limit its national applicability.

---

## Labor Certification Is Ill-Suited for This Endeavor

The labor certification process is designed for:

- fixed job titles
- static job duties
- single-employer supervision
- narrowly defined occupational roles

In contrast, this endeavor requires:

- independent research judgment
- cross-sector engagement
- publication-driven advancement
- continuous methodological development
- responsiveness to evolving federal guidance

These characteristics are incompatible with traditional labor certification structures.

---

## National Interest Benefits of a Waiver

Granting a waiver enables:

- continued advancement of hydrogen emissions modeling aligned with federal policy
- independent validation of Section 45V qualification pathways
- support for federal hydrogen hub investments
- prevention of lifecycle emissions misreporting
- improved integrity of public incentive programs

The work directly supports:

- U.S. Department of Energy hydrogen initiatives
- Treasury implementation of clean hydrogen tax credits
- national decarbonization objectives
- energy security and grid reliability planning

---

## Public Benefit Outweighs Labor Market Protection

The petitioner’s work does not displace U.S. workers.

Instead, it:

- provides analytical tools used by industry, regulators, and policymakers
- improves decision quality for hydrogen project developers
- strengthens federal oversight capability
- reduces taxpayer exposure to misallocated incentives

The benefit accrues broadly to the United States economy and public institutions rather than to a single employer.

---

## Conclusion

Because the petitioner’s endeavor:

- addresses a nationally important technical problem
- requires independence beyond a single employer
- supports federal energy and climate programs
- provides public-interest analytical infrastructure

the United States derives substantially greater benefit from waiving the labor certification and job offer requirements than from enforcing them.

Accordingly, the balance of benefits strongly favors granting a National Interest Waiver.

# Dhanasar Prong 3 – Balance of Benefits

## Summary

Waiving the labor certification requirement provides a clear benefit to the United States that outweighs the protections offered by the traditional PERM process.

The petitioner’s work focuses on accurate carbon intensity modeling of electrolytic hydrogen production under time-varying electricity grid conditions. This work directly supports federal climate policy implementation, clean hydrogen market integrity, and responsible allocation of public incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Requiring labor certification would delay or restrict deployment of urgently needed analytical capabilities that are national in scope and not tied to a single employer or job description.


## Limitations of the Labor Certification Process

The PERM labor certification framework is designed for:

- static job roles  
- employer-specific positions  
- narrowly defined occupational duties  

The petitioner’s work does not fit within these constraints.

This research:

- spans multiple institutions and agencies  
- supports national policy analysis rather than a single employer  
- evolves with regulatory guidance and grid conditions  
- requires independent publication and scientific validation  

Its value lies in public accessibility, methodological transparency, and cross-sector applicability, which cannot be achieved through employer-restricted sponsorship.


## National Interest Requires Independent Contribution

Accurate hydrogen lifecycle emissions accounting is required for:

- qualification under Section 45V tax credits  
- enforcement of time-matching and additionality rules  
- prevention of emissions arbitrage  
- protection of billions of dollars in federal investment  

These objectives require:

- independent modeling frameworks  
- transparent assumptions  
- peer-reviewed validation  
- dissemination beyond private employers  

Restricting this work to a single employer would reduce its usefulness to federal agencies and policymakers.


## Urgency of National Energy Transition

The United States is actively executing:

- the DOE Hydrogen Shot initiative  
- Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub deployment  
- Treasury implementation of Section 45V guidance  
- lifecycle emissions oversight across hydrogen markets  

These efforts are occurring in real time.

Delays created by labor certification would hinder:

- timely policy evaluation  
- rapid model refinement  
- dissemination of validated methodologies  

The national interest favors immediate and flexible contribution.


## Demonstrated Ability to Advance the Endeavor

The petitioner has demonstrated the ability to advance this endeavor through:

- peer-reviewed scientific publications  
- collaboration with Argonne National Laboratory  
- international research engagement with CSIRO  
- development of reproducible modeling frameworks using MBSE and HFGT methods  

This record establishes that the petitioner is already performing work of national value.


## Benefit to the United States

Granting a national interest waiver enables the petitioner to:

- continue independent research aligned with federal climate priorities  
- collaborate freely across public and private institutions  
- publish transparent methodologies usable by regulators and industry  
- reduce emissions accounting uncertainty  
- prevent misallocation of federal incentives  
- strengthen U.S. leadership in clean energy systems modeling  

These benefits extend nationally and cannot be achieved through employer-restricted labor certification.


## Conclusion

Given:

- the national importance of hydrogen emissions accounting  
- the petitioner’s demonstrated expertise  
- the urgency of federal hydrogen deployment  
- the need for independent, publicly accessible modeling frameworks  

the United States derives substantially greater benefit from waiving the labor certification requirement than from enforcing it.

Accordingly, the balance of benefits strongly favors granting a National Interest Waiver.
