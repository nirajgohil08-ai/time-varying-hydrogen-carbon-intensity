# Dhanasar Prong 2 – Well Positioned to Advance the Proposed Endeavor

## Summary

The petitioner is well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor of improving spatio-temporal hydrogen lifecycle emissions accounting due to a combination of advanced technical expertise, original research contributions, institutional collaborations, and demonstrated capacity to translate complex systems modeling into policy-relevant decision support tools.

The petitioner’s background directly aligns with the technical, analytical, and policy challenges currently facing clean hydrogen deployment in the United States.

---

## Advanced Education and Technical Expertise

The petitioner holds graduate-level training in systems engineering and energy systems modeling, with specialized expertise in:

- life cycle assessment (LCA)
- spatio-temporal systems modeling
- electricity grid emissions analysis
- hydrogen production system modeling
- model-based systems engineering (MBSE)
- hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT)

This interdisciplinary expertise enables analysis across traditionally disconnected domains, including power systems, lifecycle emissions, operations research, and energy policy.

## Original Research Contributions

The petitioner has authored and co-authored original research advancing the methodological frontier of hydrogen emissions accounting, including:

### 1. Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Resolution of Process-Based Life Cycle Analysis  
(Model-Based Systems Engineering and Hetero-functional Graph Theory)

This work introduces a novel systems-based framework for improving the spatial and temporal resolution of conventional process-based LCA, enabling:

- explicit representation of system states and transitions  
- improved traceability of lifecycle emissions pathways  
- integration of time-dependent operational behavior  
- scalable modeling across multi-energy infrastructures  

The research expands the analytical capability of traditional LCA approaches and provides a foundation for time-resolved emissions modeling.

### 2. Spatio-Temporal Life Cycle Analysis of Electrolytic Hydrogen Production in Australia under Time-Varying CO₂ Management Schemes

This work demonstrates, through large-scale hourly simulation:

- hydrogen carbon intensity varies significantly by time and location  
- annual-average grid emissions factors can materially misrepresent true emissions  
- operational dispatch strongly influences lifecycle outcomes  
- policy qualification thresholds are sensitive to temporal resolution  

These findings directly inform emerging U.S. hydrogen policy frameworks, including Section 45V of the Inflation Reduction Act.

## National Laboratory and International Research Collaboration

The petitioner has conducted research in collaboration with:

- **CSIRO** — Australia’s National Science Agency  
- **Argonne National Laboratory** — U.S. Department of Energy  

Argonne National Laboratory is a primary developer of the GREET lifecycle model used by U.S. federal agencies.

Collaboration with these institutions demonstrates:

- independent expert validation of the petitioner’s technical capability  
- alignment with federally recognized research methodologies  
- experience operating at national-lab research standards

## Relevance to United States Hydrogen Policy

Federal agencies have explicitly identified time-resolved emissions accounting as a critical unresolved challenge.

Key policy drivers include:

- Inflation Reduction Act Section 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit  
- U.S. Department of Energy Hydrogen Shot initiative  
- DOE Hydrogen Hub (H2Hubs) program  
- Treasury guidance on lifecycle emissions measurement  

The petitioner’s work directly addresses:

- hourly electricity sourcing requirements  
- avoidance of annual-average emissions bias  
- prevention of emissions arbitrage  
- transparent lifecycle boundary definition  

These issues are central to the credibility and effectiveness of federal hydrogen incentives.

## Demonstrated Ability to Advance the Endeavor

The petitioner has demonstrated the ability to advance the proposed endeavor through:

- peer-reviewed research publications  
- reproducible modeling frameworks  
- integration of grid emissions datasets with hydrogen system models  
- development of decision-support tools applicable to real-world policy analysis  

The modeling approaches documented in this repository are not conceptual abstractions, but operational frameworks capable of evaluating:

- hourly hydrogen carbon intensity (8760 resolution)  
- regional grid variability impacts  
- policy threshold compliance  
- emissions sensitivity across dispatch scenarios  

---

## Future Work and Ongoing Impact

The petitioner intends to continue advancing this endeavor through:

- extension of models to U.S. electricity markets  
- integration with real-time grid emissions datasets  
- policy evaluation under evolving Treasury guidance  
- application to hydrogen hub project assessment  
- open-source dissemination for regulatory transparency  

The petitioner’s established research trajectory demonstrates both continuity and scalability of national impact.

---

## Conclusion

Based on the petitioner’s:

- advanced technical education  
- original peer-reviewed research  
- collaboration with national laboratories  
- direct alignment with federal hydrogen policy needs  
- demonstrated ability to produce decision-relevant modeling frameworks  

the petitioner is well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor of improving hydrogen lifecycle emissions accounting under time-varying grid conditions.

Accordingly, the petitioner satisfies **Dhanasar Prong 2**.
