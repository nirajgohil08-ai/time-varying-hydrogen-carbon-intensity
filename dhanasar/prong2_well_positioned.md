# Dhanasar Prong 2 – Well Positioned to Advance the Proposed Endeavor

## Summary

The petitioner is well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor of developing and disseminating time-resolved hydrogen lifecycle carbon intensity modeling frameworks.

This conclusion is supported by the petitioner’s advanced technical training, original research contributions, peer-reviewed publications, demonstrated systems-level expertise, and the existence of a functioning, publicly documented computational framework capable of informing real-world hydrogen deployment and emissions accounting decisions.

## Advanced Expertise and Specialized Knowledge

The petitioner possesses specialized expertise at the intersection of:

- hydrogen energy systems modeling  
- process-based life cycle assessment (LCA)  
- spatio-temporal emissions accounting  
- model-based systems engineering (MBSE)  
- hetero-functional graph theory (HFGT)  

This combination of skills is uncommon and directly relevant to addressing the technical limitations of conventional hydrogen carbon intensity assessment approaches.

The work goes beyond standard lifecycle accounting by explicitly modeling:

- hourly electricity grid dispatch behavior  
- regional generation mix variability  
- marginal emissions dynamics  
- operational electrolyzer scheduling effects  

These capabilities require advanced analytical training and systems modeling proficiency not typically possessed by general energy analysts.

## Record of Original Research Contributions

The petitioner has authored and co-authored original research that introduces methodological advances in hydrogen emissions accounting, including:

### 1. Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Resolution of Process-Based Life Cycle Analysis  
*(Model-Based Systems Engineering & Hetero-functional Graph Theory)*

This work demonstrates:

- integration of MBSE architecture with process-based LCA  
- formal system boundary definition across spatial and temporal dimensions  
- elimination of static annual-average emissions assumptions  
- quantification of error introduced by coarse temporal resolution  

### 2. Spatio-Temporal Life Cycle Analysis of Electrolytic Hydrogen Production in Australia  
*(Time-Varying CO₂ Management Schemes)*

This research:

- evaluates hydrogen carbon intensity across 8,760 hourly time steps  
- demonstrates the sensitivity of hydrogen CI to operational dispatch  
- reveals substantial divergence between annual-average and hourly-resolved emissions values  
- provides direct relevance to policy qualification frameworks similar to U.S. Section 45V  

Together, these papers establish a documented record of original contribution and technical leadership in an emerging and nationally relevant research domain.

## Demonstrated Ability to Execute the Endeavor

The petitioner has already demonstrated the ability to advance the proposed endeavor through:

- development of a reproducible computational modeling framework  
- generation of peer-review-quality analytical results  
- transparent documentation of assumptions and system boundaries  
- publication-ready figures, simulations, and datasets  

The GitHub repository accompanying this petition contains:

- executable modeling workflows  
- clearly defined data inputs and outputs  
- documented methodology linking research to policy relevance  
- public access to research papers validating the approach  

This demonstrates not merely theoretical capability, but practical execution.

## Institutional and Research Environment Experience

The petitioner’s work has been informed by collaboration with and methodologies derived from:

- national research laboratories  
- international research institutions  
- established lifecycle modeling frameworks such as GREET-based approaches  

This exposure ensures that the proposed endeavor aligns with real-world analytical standards rather than purely academic abstraction.

## Independence from Employer Sponsorship

The proposed endeavor is not dependent on a single employer, laboratory, or commercial entity.

The modeling framework:

- can be applied across regions and electricity markets  
- supports multiple hydrogen production configurations  
- is adaptable to evolving regulatory guidance  
- is suitable for industry, policy, and research use  

This independence further supports the petitioner’s ability to continue advancing the endeavor without reliance on employer-specific infrastructure.

## Ongoing and Future Advancement Plan

The petitioner is well positioned to advance the endeavor through:

- extension of the framework to U.S. electricity markets  
- incorporation of real-time grid emissions datasets  
- evaluation of policy qualification thresholds and compliance risk  
- continued publication and dissemination of results  
- collaboration with industry, research institutions, and policymakers  

The repository serves as a foundational platform for continued development and deployment of time-resolved hydrogen emissions modeling.

## Conclusion

Based on the petitioner’s:

- specialized technical expertise  
- original research contributions  
- peer-reviewed publications  
- demonstrated modeling capability  
- publicly accessible computational framework  
- clear plan for continued advancement  

the petitioner is exceptionally well positioned to advance the proposed endeavor of improving hydrogen lifecycle carbon intensity accounting under time-varying grid conditions.
