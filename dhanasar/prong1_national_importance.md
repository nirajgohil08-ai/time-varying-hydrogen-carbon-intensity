# Dhanasar Prong 1 – National Importance

## Summary

This repository supports a nationally important endeavor focused on
quantifying the carbon intensity of electrolytic hydrogen production
under time-varying electricity grid conditions.

Hydrogen plays a central role in U.S. decarbonization strategy,
including federal investments under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)
and production tax credits under Section 45V of the Internal Revenue Code.

Accurate accounting of hydrogen lifecycle emissions is critical to:

- determining eligibility for federal tax incentives
- preventing emissions arbitrage
- enabling credible clean hydrogen deployment
- supporting national climate and energy security goals

---

## National Context

The United States has committed over $7 billion toward clean hydrogen
development through the Department of Energy Hydrogen Hubs program.

Federal agencies including:

- U.S. Department of Energy
- U.S. Department of the Treasury
- National Renewable Energy Laboratory
- Argonne National Laboratory

have identified hydrogen lifecycle emissions accounting as a major
technical challenge.

Current industry practice often relies on:

- annual-average grid emissions factors
- static electricity assumptions
- simplified temporal boundaries

These methods can significantly misrepresent real-world emissions.

---

## National Problem Addressed

Hydrogen carbon intensity is highly sensitive to:

- hourly grid dispatch
- regional generation mix
- marginal power plant behavior
- electrolyzer operating schedules

Using annual-average emissions values can:

- overstate climate benefits
- allow qualification of high-emissions hydrogen
- misallocate federal tax credits
- undermine public trust in clean energy programs

This issue has direct fiscal, environmental, and policy implications
at the national level.

## Contribution of This Work

This repository introduces a framework that:

- models hydrogen emissions at hourly temporal resolution
- integrates real electricity grid emissions data
- eliminates annual-average emissions bias
- supports spatial and temporal life cycle assessment
- aligns directly with Section 45V emissions thresholds

The framework enables comparison between:

- conventional annual-average LCA methods
- time-resolved operational LCA approaches

This capability is essential for credible hydrogen policy implementation.

---

## National Impact Areas

This work directly supports:

- U.S. clean hydrogen deployment
- federal tax credit qualification under Section 45V
- emissions integrity and accountability
- grid-integrated electrolyzer operation
- decarbonization of hard-to-abate sectors

The outcomes influence decision-making across:

- federal agencies
- energy developers
- utilities
- national laboratories
- policy analysts

---

## Conclusion

Because this work addresses a core national challenge in clean hydrogen
policy implementation, grid decarbonization, and federal incentive
allocation, the endeavor clearly possesses substantial merit and
national importance under the Dhanasar framework.
